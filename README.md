# Data-Cleaning-Project
In this project, I undertook the data cleaning challenge by working with the FIFA 21 dataset sourced from the Sofifa website. The initial data presented a significant degree of disorganization and untidiness.   The primary objective of this project was to transform and streamline the dataset for more accurate data-driven insights.

# FIFA 21 Dataset Cleaning Project

## Overview

Welcome to the FIFA 21 Dataset Cleaning Project. In this project, we tackled the challenge of cleaning and organizing the FIFA 21 dataset sourced from the Sofifa website. The dataset, in its original form, was disorganized and untidy, making it challenging to derive meaningful insights.

The primary goal of this project was to transform and streamline the dataset to make it suitable for accurate data-driven analysis. The cleaned dataset will not only be more organized but will also facilitate more insightful and reliable conclusions related to FIFA 21.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning**: Our main objective was to clean the FIFA 21 dataset. This involved dealing with missing values, standardizing data formats, and ensuring data consistency.

2. **Data Transformation**: We aimed to transform the dataset into a structured and well-organized format. This process included reformatting columns, creating new features, and enhancing data readability.

3. **Enhanced Insights**: With a clean and organized dataset, we can now obtain more accurate insights into various aspects of FIFA 21, including player statistics, team performance, and more.

4. **Improved Data Utilization**: The cleaned dataset can be used for various data analytics, machine learning, or data visualization projects related to FIFA 21.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Collection**: We collected the FIFA 21 dataset from the Sofifa website.

2. **Data Assessment**: We assessed the dataset to identify issues such as missing data, inconsistent formats, and other data quality problems.

3. **Data Cleaning**: This phase involved handling missing values, standardizing data types, and addressing data quality issues.

4. **Data Transformation**: We transformed the dataset to improve its structure and readability.

5. **Data Analysis**: With the cleaned dataset, you can conduct various analyses and derive meaningful insights.

6. **Project Conclusion**: We summarize the outcomes of the project and provide insights into the cleaned dataset.

## How to Use the Cleaned Dataset

To use the cleaned FIFA 21 dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Download**: You can download the cleaned dataset from [this link](https://github.com/CtrlJil/FIFA-21-Data-Cleaning-Project/blob/main/FIFA_21_clean_dataset.csv).

2. **Data Analysis**: Import the dataset into your preferred data analysis tool (e.g., Python with Pandas, R, or Excel) to perform your desired analysis.

3. **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to better understand FIFA 21 data trends.

4. **Machine Learning**: If you're into machine learning, you can use the dataset to build predictive models.
