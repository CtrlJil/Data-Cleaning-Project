# Data-Cleaning-Project
In this project, I undertook the data cleaning challenge by working with the FIFA 21 dataset sourced from the Sofifa website. The initial data presented a significant degree of disorganization and untidiness.   The primary objective of this project was to transform and streamline the dataset for more accurate data-driven insights.
